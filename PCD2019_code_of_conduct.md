# Code of Conduct

| original Code of Conduct from [PCD 2019 Organizer's Kit](https://day.processing.org/doc/PCDOrganizer'sKit.pdf), page 5-10.

All participants in Processing Community Day (PCD) - including, but not limited to the PCD online forum are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, speakers, performers, workshop leaders, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.

The PCD team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Anyone participant who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from PCD at the discretion of the PCD organizers.

This Code of Conduct is subject to change and expansion. Last updated August 27, 2018.

### Be mindful of your language 
Engage with community members, mentors, and contributors with respect and good intention.

### Use your best judgement
If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not say it or post to the community forum.

### Be respectful
While disagreements may arise, it is not an opportunity to attack or threaten someone else’s thoughts and/or opinions. Remember to approach every situation with patience, understanding, and great care.

### Be intentional
Consider how your contribution will affect others in the community.

### Be open minded
Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion

## Consequences, Reporting and Enforcement on Processing Community Day
Please contact Xin Xin, Dorothy Santos, Johanna Hedva, Lauren McCarthy, Casey Reas, or Dan Shiffman listed on [day.processing.org/people](https://day.processing.org/people). This team of organizers will be trained in how to address and report any incidents attendees bring to our attention. You may also contact us via email at [day@processing.org](mailto:day@processing.org).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the PCD team may take action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all PCD spaces (both on and offline) and identification of the participant as a harasser to other PCD community members and/or the general public.

## Forum - [discourse.processing.org](https://discourse.processing.org)
Please contact a PCD organizer via direct message. If the person who is harassing you is a member of staff, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence. 
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct on the forum, we ask you report it by sending an email to [day@processing.org](mailto:day@processing.org). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we respond as quickly as possible
